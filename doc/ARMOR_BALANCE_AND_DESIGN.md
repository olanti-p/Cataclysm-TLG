# Armor Balance And Design

## Armor Overview
Armor in cataclysm has varying levels of complexity to attempt a deep simulation of worn clothing. Compared with systems that try to compress down armor to one or two numbers like Pen And Paper game armor class systems or CRPGs with systems like DT and DR (flat and multiplicative reduction), Cataclysm attempts to more accurately simulate different materials, their relative coverage of the body, and how that interacts with the player.  A lot of this is simplified or clarified to the player in a way that is digestible. We *shouldn't* hide info from the player but we should *avoid* information overload.

That said this document will practice no such restraint and is designed to be a complete guide to *everything* possible. This guide will cover the basic ideas of **how it works**, **what is necessary** for armor to function, **what is possible** with the armor system and **how to design armor** so that it is balanced and makes sense. An **FAQ** will also be included to cover some specifics people might have about armor or how to understand it as well as a section on things to be added **looking forward**.  Each section will also give specific example item ids you could investigate for examples (as well as code snippets) or for balance considerations.

## How it works
Characters in Cataclysm wear armor. This armor provides them with protection, warmth, encumbrance and depending on material helps them breathe when they sweat.

## Physical attacks
When you take a direct hit in Cataclysm the following happens:
1. When the player is hit at a specific body part, first a sub-location on the limb is generated from the weighted list of sub-limbs
2. For the torso location an additional secondary sub-limb is chosen for items hanging off the player (like backpacks)
3. Armor coverage determines whether any armor is hit, or an uncovered part of the player is hit (roll a single `1d100` against coverage).
4. Go through all worn armor from the most outward clothing piece inwards. Reducing the total damage as you apply the defense of each item.
5. If the armor doesn't cover the chosen sub body part skip it.
6. Depending on the attack the armors melee, ranged or general coverage (which is not scaled to the overall body part and instead just how much of the sub-limb it covers) is compared to the roll from above.
7. In the future Vitals Coverage will be used to scale incoming critical damage, reducing crit multipliers but it is not implemented yet.
8. If the above roll fails (ie roll value is above coverage), then the armor does not absorb any damage from the blow, neither does it become damaged.
9. If the above roll succeeds, the armor is hit, possibly absorbing some damage and possibly getting damaged in the process.
10. If the armor has ABLATIVE pockets (like ballistic vests) at this point the coverage of those plates is rolled to see if they possibly absorb some damage and possibly get damaged in the process. At most one ablative pocket on an item can apply to an attack and the coverage of the plates is scaled based on the coverage of the armor they are in. This is because if a plate covers 45% of the torso but the clothing its in only covers 50% of the torso, you already know the attack hit the jacket and the jacket is 90% (45/50) plate.
11. Armor protects against damage.  The values are determined by multiplying the armor thickness by the materials individual damage type resistance factor respectively, given in `materials.json`.
12. For simple definition armors: If the armor is made from more than 1 material types, then it divides the armors overall thickness based on proportions each is (assumes equal proportions by default). Giving a single protection value per type of damage.
13. For complex definition armors: Each material on each limb/sub-limb can have a specific thickness and also an amount of the overall armored portion that it covers (proportional_coverage). Each individual material is rolled against its proportional_coverage vs `1d100` to see if it applies to any given attack. That is why some armors have a red (worst case) percent, green (best case) percent and a median protection value now because an armor itself can have variable protection for any given attack. This is to simulate armor with padding or plating that don't fully cover it.

Specifically to ablative plates, some transform when damaged instead of damaging normally. The chance of transforming scales based on damage taken.

### Nonphysical Attacks
Attacks which are not the result of a solid object crashing into you at high speeds, such as lasers, blasts of cold air, and acid use different systems.
1. Fire: Fire can harm in three different ways: First, as part of a fire attack, such as a blast from a flamethrower or a laser gun. Your armor can prevent these attacks from hitting your body based on the armor's coverage and its fire armor value, though the armor has a chance of being lit on fire in the process. This can cause gear to ignite, which sets the wearer on fire, which is the second way fire can do harm. This also happens if a character or monster steps into a tile containing fire. Characters and monsters with high enough armor values may not be set on fire this way, and may receive reduced or even no damage from exposure to flames in their tile. The third way fire causes harm is via hot air, which currently only affects characters and not monsters. Hot air is generated by open flames and moves to adjacent tiles, where it will raise the ambient temperature. This effect is mitigated by ventilation or climate control, but the best defense is simply to leave the area.
2. Acid: Acid is a bit simpler. An amount of acid determined by the attack splashes onto a character and may interact with their gear based on its coverage. If it does, it may attempt to damage the item, checking against the item's acid resistance. In either case, an amount of the initial attack's liquid volume is deflected according to the gear's coverage and breathability, with non-breathable gear deflecting more acid and being more resistant to its effects. If any remains, it will go on to check the next layer until it is either all deflected or reaches the character's skin, where it will apply the corroding effect. Other liquid attacks may use similar mechanics to apply their effects, but won't check the armor's acid resistance value.
3. Electricity: Electricity is the simplest type of damage - armor does not offer numerical protection against it. Rather, it confers total immunity via the Grounded effect, or none at all.

### Environmental Protection
Environmental attacks are those from non-physical sources that are neither liquids nor direct sources of damage. At present, that includes airborne pathogens, poison gas, and smoke.

### Warmth
Is a particularly arcane system helping to insulate the character keeping them warm. The more warm your armor the more you'll sweat and the hotter you'll be.

### Material Thickness
Material thickness is how most protection values are automatically derived. This number is measured in millimeters and should roughly reflect the average real-world thickness of such an item, assuming it is dry and gently pressed flat against the body. This is especially important for materials like fur or wool which can have nap or hairs that could artificially inflate its thickness - most of that animal hair is just empty air if it's standing up, and empty air does not protect against attacks!

Example thickness values for typical items:
* Live human skin: 0.5mm to 4mm. Skin is typically 1.5mm thick across the palms and soles, getting up to 4mm across the back and shoulders. It is thinnest on the eyelids and other obviously sensitive areas. This thickness includes the dermis and epidermis but not the hypodermis (fascia, subcutaneous fat, etc). While skin does protect the human body, human skin is not treated by the game as integrated armor - all characters and monsters are assumed to have at least a human skin level of natural protection. It is listed here only as an example.
* Tanned human leather: 0.5 to 2mm. Human skin does not make particularly good leather. Historically it has mostly been used for scientific purposes or for macabre decoration (ie bookbinding).
* Live cow skin, including fur: 1-10mm. Thickest across the back and shoulders, thinnest along the belly. The fur contributes about 1mm
* Cow leather: 0.5 to 4mm, another 1mm if the fur is still on.
* Moose or bear leather: 4 to 6mm. The thickest natural hide available in the region. It would have another 1.5mm with the fur.
* Feathers: 1 to 2mm, assuming we mean a coat of feathers as a bird would have, without the underlying skin. In reality the thickness would seem much higher due to the loosely stacking structure of feathers, but most of this is air. In terms of solid matter, 1-2mm is appropriate. Large birds such as ostriches tend to have skin that is about 0.5 to 4mm thick.
* Scales: Not counting the underlying skin, scales add between 1mm and 7mm of thickness, depending on the body part and type of scales.
* Epicuticle, phelloderm, etc.: 0.5 to 4mm. New tissue material largely replaces the dermis and epidermis, and in these cases its thickness should be distributed the same way.
* Small animal skin, no fur: 0.5 to 2mm. This includes rabbits, squirrels, and chickens.
* Small animal leather, no fur: 0.5 to 1mm. This includes rabbits, squirrels, and chickens.
* T-shirt, panties, boxers, etc: 0.1 to 0.2mm.
* Padded bra: 2mm. Note that most bras aren't padded.
* Denim: 0.7mm to 1.2mm. Typical jeans would be on the lower end, with things like 18oz jeans or jackets on the upper end. Skinny jeans are made of a denim-lycra blend and are much thinner.
* Leather (fashion): 1mm for items like the leather jacket or leather pants.
* Leather (work/road gear): 1.5mm for protective items like the motorcycle jacket to 3mm for high quality work boots.
* Leather (actual armor): 4mm for super heavy items like a leather cuirass. This is pushing the limits of what is wearable. Places that don't need to be flexible like the forearms, can go a bit higher.
* Chitin, giant arthropod: 2-5mm for typical stuff, up to 15mm for very giant monsters. 2-5mm is not actually all that much thicker than the shell of a good-sized lobster or crab IRL. This is partly because of the square-cube law. As an animal becomes larger, it becomes dramatically heavier. Structures like endoskeletons are consequentially under much more stress, and their thickness would have trouble scaling up without massively adding to this weight and immobilizing the creature. Our biggest bugs have pseudo-endoskeletons, but 15mm would still be the absolute limit even for something bigger than a cow.
* Fur, as in a fur coat: 2-3mm.
* Vinyl raincoat: Up to 0.5mm.
* Windbreaker: 0.2mm.
* Pantyhose: 0.01mm.
* Leggings: 0.1mm. Leggings in this game refer to the stretchy "pants" that can be worn for exercise or fashion, usually by women.
* Work coveralls: 0.6mm. These are durable nylon workwear.

## Armor-specific values
"Armor" in this case can refer to any worn item, including accessories, gadgets, and clothing.

* ```"material"``` array: a list of the materials that make up the item in general.
* ```"armor"``` array: this will be described in depth later in **advanced armor definitions**.
* ```"warmth"``` value, usually between 0 - 50 based on how hot the item is to wear.
* ```"material_thickness"``` this is measured in mm, this is **the most important value to get right when designing armor**

A simple example:
```json
{
  "id": "dress_shirt",
  "type": "ARMOR",
  "name": { "str": "dress shirt" },
  "description": "A button-down shirt with long sleeves.",
  "weight": "250 g",
  "volume": "750 ml",
  "price": 1500,
  "price_postapoc": 50,
  "material": [ "cotton" ],
  "symbol": "[",
  "looks_like": "longshirt",
  "color": "white",
  "armor": [
    { "covers": [ "torso" ], "coverage": 90, "encumbrance": 4 },
    { "covers": [ "arm_l", "arm_r" ], "coverage": 90, "encumbrance": 4 }
  ],
  "warmth": 10,
  "material_thickness": 0.1,
}
```

## What is possible
This section is purely about what you can do. Basically no armor should have all of these features. Remember *the more complexity you add to something the harder it is to understand*.

Each subsection of this will consist of an **explanation of the feature**, an **example of how to use it**, and **further examples from the code**

### Advanced Armor Definitions
#### Explanation
Some items will use an old way of defining armor where their coverage and thickness are loose in the json. This is likely to be phased out. As such I would recommend **always using an advanced armor definition**. Each piece of this will be explained in detail further below but the simplest thing you can do is just define an array of objects containing a coverage value, encumbrance, and the covered locations.

#### Example
```json
"armor": [
  { "covers": [ "torso" ], "coverage": 95, "encumbrance": 4 },
  { "covers": [ "arm_l", "arm_r" ], "coverage": 90, "encumbrance": 2 }
]
```

### Layers
#### Explanation
Layers are a system in Cataclysm used to differentiate different types of clothes. Functionally things on separate layers will not conflict with each other. So you can wear underwear, jeans, knee pads and drop leg pouches without conflict. The layers are defined as flags, if you don't define a layer for an item it instead is assumed to be normal layer. The layers are (in order):
* PERSONAL - Your personal aura, this is primarily for magiclysm and sci-fi stuff.
* SKINTIGHT - Items that fit right against your body and are designed to be worn under everyday clothing. Includes concealable kevlar vests, undergarments, t-shirts, socks, and tank tops, up through futuristic skin-tight bodysuits.
* NORMAL - Clothing which is neither outerwear nor underwear. Includes everyday stuff such as sweaters, gloves, and jeans. For feet, this includes all shoes and boots. For heads, it's soft hats such as ballcaps.
* WAIST - Things worn as belts, this is an old legacy solution designed for having belts not conflict with backpacks. Use it **only** for belts on the torso.
* OUTER - Outerwear, things like winter coats, longcoats, hazmat suits, and most hard armor and helmets such as platemail. Note that helmets which are padded, like an army helmet, should occupy both the NORMAL and OUTER layer.
* BELTED - Items which are strapped or pulled on over the outermost parts of your gear. Includes most pouches and bags, as well as cloaks, hoods, and a few big weird items like wedding veils and beekeeper hoods.
* AURA - Outer aura, again magiclysm and sci-fi, not really used in core.

Items can also be on multiple layers by including additional flags. The best example of this is an OUTER armor with a lot of pouches would also be BELTED.

#### Example
```json
"flags": [ "OUTER", "BELTED" ]
```

#### Further Reading
Basically all items have a layer (or omit it to be counted as NORMAL)
The army helmet is an example of an item that is NORMAL + OUTER.

### Multi-layer
#### Explanation
Aside from a specific armor taking up multiple layers, different *parts* of an armor can take up different layers. This for example would be useful for a spacesuit, where the helmet is a large glass dome and would be OUTER but the suit itself is form fitting NORMAL layer so that you could wear armor over it. Another use case is for armor that has pouches on the torso but not on the limbs, you could specify OUTER + BELTED for torso and just OUTER for everywhere else. This is done by including the layer info in the advanced armor definition instead of with flags. If an entry doesn't have layers described it falls back to the item flags and if it doesn't have flags it falls back to NORMAL.

#### Example
```json
"flags": [ "STURDY", "OUTER" ],
"armor": [
  { "encumbrance": [ 4, 6 ], "coverage": 100, "cover_vitals": 90, "covers": [ "torso" ], "layers": [ "OUTER", "BELTED" ] },
  {
    "encumbrance": [ 4, 4 ],
    "coverage": 100,
    "cover_vitals": 90,
    "covers": [ "arm_l", "arm_r" ],
    "specifically_covers": [ "arm_shoulder_l", "arm_shoulder_r", "arm_upper_l", "arm_upper_r" ]
  },
  {
    "encumbrance": [ 4, 4 ],
    "coverage": 100,
    "cover_vitals": 90,
    "covers": [ "leg_l", "leg_r" ],
    "specifically_covers": [ "leg_hip_l", "leg_hip_r", "leg_upper_r", "leg_upper_l" ]
  }
]
```

### Sublocations
#### Explanation
Sub-locations are a new-ish feature of characters in Cataclysm. Sub-locations are sub divided pieces of characters limbs. For example a human arm consists of a lower arm, elbow, upper arm, and shoulder. All limbs have sub-locations and you can find the full list of them in the body part definitions in ```body_parts.json```. When you define specific sub-locations for armor it does the following:
* Makes it so that armor only conflicts with armor that shares sub-locations with it on it's layer
* Scales total coverage

So if you appropriately use specifically_covers a character can wear multiple pieces on the same limb and layer. For example a character could wear knee pads, and shin guards. Also when defining sub-locations and describing coverage you are describing the amount of the sub-locations the armor covers. So a pair of knee pads isn't 5% coverage, specifically covering the knees: its 90% coverage specifically covering the knees and the game is smart enough to know your knee is 5% of your leg. This is to make it simpler, just describe how much of the parts covered are covered, not how much of the overall limb.

The strapped layer also has additional sub-limbs that are used for hanging items. These currently only exist on the torso and in the json have ```"secondary": true```. They are for things hanging around your neck (like binoculars), your front (like a rifle on a sling), your back (like a backpack).

**if you don't define this for an armor it assumes that the armor covers every sub-location on that limb**

This will play more and more of a role as armor gets further developed.

#### Example
```json
"armor": [
  {
    "covers": [ "leg_l", "leg_r" ],
    "encumbrance": 0,
    "coverage": 90,
    "specifically_covers": [ "leg_knee_r", "leg_knee_l" ]
  }
]
```

### Sided Armor
#### Explanation
Sided armor is armor that even though it describes covering, both legs, both arms, both hands, etc. actually only covers one "side" at a time but can be moved back and forth between sides at will by the player. This works by setting ```"sided": true```

#### Example
```json
{
  "id": "bootsheath",
  "type": "ARMOR",
  "name": { "str": "ankle sheath" },
  "description": "A small concealed knife sheath worn on the ankle.  It is awkward to use without practice.  Activate to sheathe/draw a weapon.",
  "weight": "160 g",
  "volume": "500 ml",
  "price": 5200,
  "price_postapoc": 250,
  "to_hit": -1,
  "material": [ "leather" ],
  "symbol": "[",
  "looks_like": "sheath",
  "color": "brown",
  "sided": true,
  "material_thickness": 1,
  "pocket_data": [
    {
      "magazine_well": "200 ml",
      "holster": true,
      "flag_restriction": [ "SHEATH_KNIFE" ],
      "moves": 30,
      "max_contains_volume": "500 ml",
      "max_contains_weight": "1 kg",
      "max_item_length": "30 cm"
    }
  ],
  "use_action": { "type": "holster", "holster_prompt": "Sheath knife", "holster_msg": "You sheath your %s" },
  "flags": [ "BELTED", "OVERSIZE", "ALLOWS_NATURAL_ATTACKS", "WATER_FRIENDLY" ],
  "armor": [
    {
      "material": [ { "type": "leather", "covered_by_mat": 100, "thickness": 1 } ],
      "covers": [ "foot_l", "foot_r" ],
      "specifically_covers": [ "foot_ankle_l", "foot_ankle_r" ],
      "coverage": 25,
      "encumbrance": [ 2, 3 ],
      "layers": [ "BELTED" ]
    }
  ]
}
```

lots of holsters. The new plate armor is also sided per piece.

### Basic Materials
#### Explanation
Materials inform a lot of the information for an armor. What something is made of determines how likely it is to break, how much it protects you, how well it breaths (when you sweat). Materials can be defined in a number of ways going up in complexity. The simplest way is to specify an array of materials. When you do this it is assumed that each of the given materials is equally represented in the armor meaning if you had a 2mm thick armor and it was 2 materials it would be assumed each material was 1mm thick. You can expand this further and give each a portion value. So if you had 9 portion material A and 1 portion material B for a 1mm thick armor than it would be .9mm A and .1mm B.
#### Example
```json
  "material": [ { "type": "plastic", "portion": 1 }, { "type": "steel", "portion": 1 }, { "type": "nomex", "portion": 2 } ],
```

### Multi Material Inheritance
#### Explanation
This is a trick you can do to shorten the amount of work you need. Once you have an abstract for an armor defined, with all of the coverage and encumbrance info, you could create variants with different materials by using proportional coverage and thickness. This can be a powerful and convenient short hand.

#### Example
```json
{
  "//": "Tier 2 mantle",
  "id": "robofac_nomex_mantle",
  "type": "ARMOR",
  "copy-from": "robofac_mantle",
  "name": "Hub 01 turnout mantle",
  "description": "3D printed upper body armor, it is well finished, lightweight and it seems a lot of thought went into the ergonomics.  This is made of 3D printed plastic combined with printed Nomex and a hardened metal core to give significant reinforcement.  Designed to clip to the chest and shoulders the interior side reads ATTACH TO MODULAR DEFENSE SYSTEM.",
  "material": [ { "type": "plastic", "portion": 1 }, { "type": "steel", "portion": 1 }, { "type": "nomex", "portion": 2 } ],
  "proportional": { "weight": 2.5 }
}
```

#### Further Reading

### Repairs
#### Explanation
Clothing repairs are inherited from their material type.  Needed materials and repair difficulty are based on these materials (you can make a repair with any material it is made of, but the difficulty is whatever is the hardest part of it to repair).  In cases where the repair difficulty does not match that of its materials the ``repairs-like`` flag can be used to specify an item from which the difficulty and required skills should be inherited instead. This flag does not change the materials required to repair the item, which is always derived from its composition.

#### Example
The leather belt repairs like a leather patch because steel is more difficult to repair than leather, but the steel belt buckle is exceedingly unlikely to sustain damage compared to the leather majority of the belt.
```json
{
  "id": "belt_leather",
  "repairs_like": "leather"
}
```

### Advanced Materials
#### Explanation
It is possible to be more verbose and specific with materials and armor. To do this you can specify an array of materials for each advanced armor definition array. Each material needs at least an id and thickness (in mm) however you can also optionally specify a covered_by_mat which is how much of the armor is covered by the material. that way for example if an armor was steel but had leather straps that only covered 5% of the armor you could represent the straps as well. **At least 1 material on any armor should have 100 proportional coverage**.

#### Example
Note that the item in this example is an example of "stacked" armor which should occupy more than one layer, such as NORMAL+OUTER.
```json
"armor": [
  {
    "material": [
      { "type": "lc_steel", "covered_by_mat": 95, "thickness": 4.8 },
      { "type": "lc_steel_chain", "covered_by_mat": 100, "thickness": 1.2 },
      { "type": "leather", "covered_by_mat": 1, "thickness": 1.0 }
    ],
    "covers": [ "torso" ],
    "coverage": 100,
    "encumbrance": 25
  }
]
```

### Melee, Ranged and Vitals Coverage
#### Explanation
In the case of melee and ranged coverage they can be specified to differentiate an armors chance to absorb ranged vs. melee attacks. They behave identically to regular coverage taking it's place for those types of attacks. If not defined these default to the armors base coverage. **these are not a replacement for coverage** basic "coverage" is still used for stuff like, sun burn/wind. Primarily these can be used by modern gear that is designed to protect center of mass/practical front facing locations.

Vitals Coverage does not behave like normal coverage and a is a % reduction to the amount of bonus damage a character takes from critical hits. If you have 100% vitals protection you take no additional damage from critical hits. If you have 50% vitals protection you take half the additional damage.

#### Example
```json
{
  "material": [
    { "type": "nylon", "covered_by_mat": 100, "thickness": 3.0 },
    { "type": "kevlar_layered", "covered_by_mat": 100, "thickness": 3.0 }
  ],
  "encumbrance": 5,
  "//": "an enemy could get under the protection in melee but ranged shots should almost always be blocked",
  "coverage": 80,
  "cover_melee": 80,
  "cover_ranged": 95,
  "cover_vitals": 100,
  "covers": [ "arm_l", "arm_r" ],
  "specifically_covers": [ "arm_shoulder_l", "arm_shoulder_r", "arm_upper_l", "arm_upper_r" ],
}
```

### Pockets
#### Explanation
Armor can have pockets. They are defined as a Pocket array. A storage guide will be written separately to this. It's worth keeping in mind how pockets effect armor though.

When your armor has potential volume it can store the encumbrance of the armor defaults to scaling as the armor gets fuller and fuller. By default an armors encumbrance is equal to its empty encumbrance + (volume stored / 250ml). However this is the base encumbrance that poorly tying an item to yourself with rope would give; so any man made storage will have a better volume / encumbrance than this.

You can represent a better volume / encumbrance in 3 ways:
* The simplest is to specify the encumbrance as an array of two values "[x, y]" this means the encumbrance empty is "x" and if full the item will have encumbrance "y" between 0 and 100% volume it scales linearly.

* The more modern way to do it is to set a scaling factor on the armor itself. This is much easier to read and quickly parse (not requiring mental math) and is a direct scaling on that 250ml constant. So if I set a "volume_encumber_modifier" of .25 it means that it's one additional encumbrance per 1000ml (250ml/.25). This is defined in the advanced armor definition.

* To get really specific you can combine the above with similar "volume_encumber_modifier" but on any individual pocket of the armor. This has the same effect as above but also effects how much that pocket contributes to the overall encumbrance. An example use case would be a rifle on a tactical sling would be more encumbering per volume than magazines affixed to the same vest so you could represent it as such. This can also be used with a modifier of 0 to set it so a pocket does not contribute to encumbrance.

#### Example
simple:
```json
  "encumbrance": [4, 6]
```

complex:
```json
{
  "material": [
    { "type": "nylon", "covered_by_mat": 100, "thickness": 3.0 },
    { "type": "kevlar_layered", "covered_by_mat": 95, "thickness": 3.0 }
  ],
  "volume_encumber_modifier": 0.2,
  "encumbrance": 15,
  "coverage": 100,
  "cover_vitals": 90,
  "covers": [ "torso" ]
}
```

```json
{
  "pocket_type": "CONTAINER",
  "ablative": true,
  "volume_encumber_modifier": 0,
  "max_contains_volume": "1600 ml",
  "max_contains_weight": "5 kg",
  "moves": 200,
  "description": "Pocket for front plate",
  "flag_restriction": [ "ABLATIVE_LARGE" ]
}
```
#### Further Reading
The ammo pouches for Load Bearing Vests and the LBVs themselves make use of this heavily.


### Ablative Armor
#### Explanation
This is a unique armor system to represent, armored inserts for armor. The original use case is for ballistic armor plates that go in bullet proof vests. However other armors could use this features in a similar way it is all supported through JSON.

To use this feature set a pocket on an item to be ```"ablative": true```, and set restrictions on what can go in the pocket by flag.

Then create armor inserts like normal armor but make sure they have 2 flags, CANT_WEAR and the flag that is restricted to those pockets. The plates when in those pockets will provide protection.

Keep in mind **plates need to have less or equal coverage to the armor they are in**. If you have a vest that covers 90% of your upper torso but it has an armor plate that covers 95% of the upper torso that doesn't make any sense.


#### Example
pocket:
```json
"pocket_data": [
  {
    "pocket_type": "CONTAINER",
    "ablative": true,
    "volume_encumber_modifier": 0,
    "max_contains_volume": "1600 ml",

### Transform vs Durability
#### Explanation
Normally armor degrades with use. This degradation is incremental and decreases the armors effectiveness and protection. However not all armor degrades, some instead will become completely compromised. For these items ```"non_functional": "ITEM_ID"``` can be added. Instead of the normal degradation rules, armor with non_functional will have a chance to transform into its non_functional version when struck. Specifically transform items are concerned with how much damage they take before reduction, rather than after reduction and as the damage scales towards their total resistance (and beyond) scales to a 33% chance to transform (and beyond). Example a 50 damage bullet hitting a 50 damage plate has a 33% chance to transform, a 25 damage bullet would only have a 16.5% chance to cause a transform, 100 damage a 66% chance.

Transforming items can also specify a custom destruction message with ```"damage_verb"``` which is what will be said when it is damaged.

### Actions and Transforms
#### Explanation
Items with actions can be worn as armor. Usually you need to swap the type to ```TOOL_ARMOR```. Actions are outside the scope of this doc but a simple thing possible is a transform. The basic use case for this is something like a headlamp that can be turned on to provide light. Usually on versions of items will drain power but have additional flags and effects.

### Enchantments / Traits

#### Explanation
Some armor with custom abilities can be handled as enchantments. This is a new way of handling stuff that is more JSON friendly and doesn't require hard coded flags in C++. The best way to implement an effect on armor is to **not add the effect directly** instead it is for the armor to provide a trait which provides the effect. **this is so if you wear two of the armor it won't give double the effect**. As well it makes it obvious to the player that they have a new trait giving them power.

#### Example
```json
"relic_data": { "passive_effects": [ { "has": "WORN", "condition": "ALWAYS", "mutations": [ "well_distributed" ] } ] }
```

```json
{
  "type": "mutation",
  "id": "well_distributed",
  "name": { "str": "Well Distributed Gear" },
  "points": 0,
  "description": "You are wearing equipment that helps to distribute weight allowing you to carry more.",
  "valid": false,
  "purifiable": false,
  "types": [ "Equipment" ],
  "enchantments": [ { "values": [ { "value": "CARRY_WEIGHT", "multiply": 0.1 } ] } ]
}
```

## Making your own items
When you want to add a new item to Cataclysm there are a few things you should prioritize, focus on and consider.

### Balance/Considerations

#### The Golden Rule Of Balance
The core ideal when making any item but especially armor is that **weight, thickness and materials should be correct** if the item is real it should be exactly as it is in real life, if it is created for Cataclysm it should be similar to other true to life armors. It does not matter if you think that your pet project leather armor *should* be better, if a leather jacket is 1.2mm thick and that gives it 4.4 bash protection and you think that is too low, **you can not just make it thicker**. Armor should be based off real life thickness values. If after making something true to life it isn't behaving true to life then a discussion about how to solve it can be had. Materials might need adjusting or a new material might need to be defined (we have 3 types of Kevlar and 3-4 types of plastic) or perhaps your assumptions / materials are wrong. Any solution however should come with proper research since it will have long reaching effects. The reasoning for this golden rule is it consolidates balancing at the material level making it much easier to research and get info and leads to less favoritism and outliers.

#### The Golden Rule Of Design
Make things as simple as they possibly can be. When a player inspects a t-shirt they shouldn't have to inspect 35 lines of armor data that could be summarized as "basically no protection, keeps you kinda warm". Advanced and dedicated armor can be *very* complicated but try to keep clothing as complex as they need to be to be simulated correctly.

#### Subjective Values
With the above mentioned you should be able to intuit/research sensible materials, thicknesses, flags, and weight.  Your core variables that are more discretionary are warmth, encumbrance, layer and coverage.

#### Layer
Layers are an easy way for things to get weird, as there aren't many of them and you often see things like t-shirts and bras competing for the same slot, when realistically people wear both all the time. This is fine to a degree - competing layers aren't the end of the world when it only amounts to 2 extra encumbrance.
* Integrated: This is for "items" which are a part of the character's body. It is generally used for mutations, but is sometimes appropriate for bionics. Integrated items should also occupy other layers in cases where they are bulky enough to prevent other items from being worn, such as a gastropod's shell or a bionic arm-blade.
* Skintight: Usually 1mm or less. These items are intended to be worn under or instead of other clothing, and are probably always soft. You should reasonably be able to wear a ballcap, jeans, gloves, shoes, or a hoodie over most of them.
* Normal: Usually 2mm or less. These items include non-t-shirts, hoodies, most pants, ballcaps, and beanies. You should reasonably be able to wear an unpadded helmet or a coat over most of them. Glasses should fit here.
* Outer: Includes cuirasses, helmets, jackets, and coats. Shoes should occupy both the outer and normal layers. Goggles should occupy the outer layer if there's room to wear glasses under them, or both the normal and outer layer if there isn't.
* Strapped: Includes most bags but also includes things like cloaks and hoods, as well as certain armor pieces that can be draped or tied on over an outfit, such as tassets and aventails.

#### Multi-layer items
If an item is hard outerwear (such as a helmet) that includes padding, it should probably have both the NORMAL and OUTER flags, as this padding would conflict with items worn beneath it, such as a ballcap. Similarly, if an item is just multiple layered items stacked together into a single piece, such as faraday plate mail, it should not sit on a single layer. Some items include bits that should have individual layer data, such as motorcycle pants, which should have a BELTED and RIGID_LAYER_ONLY flag on their knees due to their integrated kneepads.

#### Warmth
Warmth should be based on materials, look at armors similar to what you are making and go from there. Also it is worth considering how much of the body is covered.

#### Coverage
Coverage should basically never be 100% across the entire body unless the armor is actually fully enclosed, such as a phase immersion suit. Coverage should only be 100% on any body part in cases where it fully encloses that body part and, without openings or gaps, continues on to cover part or all of the next body part. An example of this would be a boiler suit offering 100% coverage to the lower torso and upper legs. Anywhere there is an opening, even if it does not hang loosely, a glob of acid could slip past or a mace could strike a point which is does not present adequate resistance to stop it. This includes sleeve openings, pant cuffs, jacket collars, the area beneath the rim of a helmet, etc. This means than on all such body parts, coverage should never be higher than 98%.

Coverage NEVER includes items which are not part of the item itself. Yes you should probably be wearing a gambeson under your cuirass, but the gambeson handles its own coverage, the imagined presence of one has no bearing on what a metal breastplate by itself can cover. Similarly, arguments about how plate mail was actually impervious to 100% of attacks and you could only defeat someone by inserting a specially made needle through a 1mm eye hole or something are not going to be entertained - people would not have brought spears and swords into battle if they weren't at least somewhat effective, and coverage is a fairly abstract device in order to help us simulate both the effectiveness of armor and the sometimes-effectiveness of weapons.

Some loose guidelines:
Lower Arm 98%: The cuff of a long sleeve has a button or strap to secure it tightly to the wrist specifically to protect it in this way.
Upper Torso 95%: The long-sleeved shirt has a high collar which can be buttoned up.
Lower Leg 90%: The pants have fairly wide cuffs.
Lower Arm 65%: The archer's vambrace does not extend fully to the elbow.
Head 50% (crown 100%, forehead 100%, ears 50%): The advanced combat helmet is designed to protect the most important parts of a soldier's head without getting in the way, but wasn't intended for melee combat.
Below 50%: This item is worse than a coin toss, and probably won't seriously be considered as a primary source of protection by anyone but the most desperate players. This is fine if we're just representing something like an eyepatch that isn't really supposed to be armor, but for actual purpose-built armor pieces, anything this low is not going to make an attractive option unless it has something else going for it, like for example it's worn on the strapped layer and doesn't interfere with the character's other gear.

Doing coverage by subparts is the preferable model for going forward, but existing items that don't have subpart data set up can just average their coverage across subparts (adjusting for their relative size!) and make that the encumbrance for the whole body part.

Coverage is just a d100 roll. A piece of armor with 95% coverage is **4 times better** than an armor with 80% coverage when it comes to protecting against attacks. Because each layer is rolled independently, the chances of an individual attack getting past all of a well-equipped character's layers of defense wind up being quite low, which is fine because late-game attacks do a lot of damage and players in melee combat are probably getting hit very frequently.

#### Encumbrance
Encumbrance applies to body parts and affects the limb scores attached to that body part in mostly logical ways. Foot encumbrance reduces footing and move speed, hand encumbrance reduces manipulation, eye encumbrance reduces sight, and so on. Encumbrance is not simply a tradeoff for armor stats, it is meant to represent items which are bulky, unbalanced, uncomfortable, or which get in the way of movement or sensation, and purpose-built items tend to do a lot to try to offset these factors. A good example here is that a solid pair of steel toed treated leather boots should be well below the encumbrance of a simple pair of sandals - the expectation is that the boots would provide better traction, while the sandals would be more likely to trip you up, despite being much lighter and offering practically no protection. A pair of sneakers of course would be less encumbering than either.

Armor can conflict with other armor, this is to simulate things being uncomfortable or awkwardly pressing against each other. If this happens, the encumbrance of each piece of armor other than the most encumbering is added to your character. If any piece has an encumbrance less than 2 their penalty is 2. For example if you were wearing 2 tank tops, at 1 encumbrance each your total torso encumbrance would be 1 + 1 + 2 = 4,  1 for each tank top and 2 for the conflict (since it will be at minimum 2).

Encumbrance is always going to be a rough estimate. Some people can't stand wearing corsets and feel like they're dying, others wear them every day without issue. The best we can do is try to ballpark it using the following guidelines. When setting values, try to consider what a reasonable full outfit which might incorporate this item would look like (such as plate mail, chain mail, a gambeson, and some underwear), and ensure that said outfit sits within the expected overall encumbrance values below.

Overall encumbrance values for an entire outfit (per body part):
* 0-9: Like wearing nothing at all.
* 10-14: Minor but totally acceptable hindrance.
* 15-19: Typical for everyday wear, especially when outdoors.
* 20-24: The outfit is fairly bulky or restrictive.
* 25-30: Starting to become intolerable, equivalent to wearing a gas mask.
* 31-35: The upper bounds of tolerability in combat. About where you'd expect a three layer suit of armor (IE plate+chain+gambeson) to land.
* 36-40: The point at which encumbrance values start to make combat unviable. Full fur outfit and an overloaded pack.
* 41+: The body part is restricted to a debilitating degree. No one would wear this much stuff if they didn't have to.
* 51+: Wearing way too much, or wearing items which make normal life impossible. Mittens, a space suit, stiletto heeled boots that don't fit, etc.

Example encumbrance values for individual items, assuming they fit and their pockets are empty unless otherwise mentioned:
* 0: Only those items which are actually completely inconsequential. Badge, bra, boxers, earring, body paint.
* 1-3: Items which are basically inconsequential. Socks, t-shirt, long-sleeved shirt, watch, fanny pack (empty), kerchief.
* 4-6: Lightweight clothing. Glove liners, fingerless gloves, bandana, cargo pants/shorts (empty), sweater, ski jacket, ballcap, jeans, leather jacket/longcoat/pants/shorts, sneakers, bandana, glasses.
* 7-13: Midweight clothing or light to medium armor. Survivor suits (all), down jacket, fur coat, boots, leather riding jacket, armored leather jacket, chainmail, brigandine, concealable ballistic vest, leather gauntlets, army helmet, survivor suit, leather corset (loose), dust mask, wetsuit.
* 14-20: Heavy or restrictive gear. Metal cuirass, turnout coat, heavy plate carrier (with inserts), tire armor, leather corset, rubber boots, hazmat suits, tanker helm, sharksuit, filter mask.
* 21-26: Stuff that sucks to wear but doesn't make activity impossible on its own. Gas mask, goggles, motorcycle helmet, tire armor, a very full backpack.
* 27-33: Multi-layered gear or pieces that severely restrict movement. Faraday armor, stripper heels, clown shoes, bite suit.
* 34-40: You had better have a damn good reason for wearing this. Phase immersion suit (both on and off), entry suit, mascot suit, mittens, swim fins on dry land, snow goggles (traditional).
* 50+: Normal function is impossible in these items. Welding goggles/mask, sleeping bag, body bag, straitjacket, handcuffs.

When doing encumbrance per volume, you should use volume_encumber_modifier. Some good modifiers to use are:
* .4+ poorly designed/improvised storage
* .4 stuff not well fixed to you and hanging like rifles on slings
* .3 reasonable value for armor and strapped pouches designed for combat, but accessible.
* .2 very well affixed pouches (should have a higher base encumbrance on the item to compensate)
* 0 all ablative pockets (their encumbrance is added from their armor directly)

Keep in mind that, for example, if something covers the legs and the torso you can split that ".3" over the legs and torso so the torso becomes ".15" and the legs are each ".1". This probably should never be perfect unless it is an excellently designed storage system.

Also the above values assume things being focused around the torso, shoulders, hips and thighs for the same reason mentioned above the further out from your center something is the worse it should be.

### What 'Just Works'
Aside from what is described in this guide a lot of the behind the scenes calculations are just handled for you. So for example the info displayed in game per limb is an amalgamation of all of your sub-limb entries consolidated. This is just to simplify a single display to the player but is still very useful.

## FAQ
Space left for questions as they arise.

## Looking Forward
In the future ideally
* Warmth will be handled by material + thickness, or at least scaled by armor coverage.
* Encumbrance will be entirely handled by material, thickness, 1 - 2 descriptive words, sub-location coverage, coverage (using the 6 tenets from above).
* Characters will be able to wear human armor on non human limbs with scaling coverage based on how closely their limbs approximate the sub-limbs that the armor normally covers.
* All old armors will be overhauled to have better and more detailed information.
* More material refinement.
